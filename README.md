## About The Project

This project is part of our submission to the MakeUC 2022 hackathon. Our project submission can be viewed [here](https://devpost.com/software/icebreakerbot) on Devpost. Below is an exerpt from our project submission.

### Devpost Project Submission Exerpt

#### Inspiration
We were inspired by the "Global Connectivity" track of the hackathon and decided to come up with something that helps to bring people together. A problem we have discovered as part of this track, is that sometimes when people come together, there tend to be awkward silence and a lack of momentum to get the conversation going.

#### What it does
Following our inspiration, we have decided to create a telegram bot to solve the issue as it is a popular messaging app that most people already have installed, thus mitigating the issue of barriers to entry. Our telegram bot does mainly two things: 1. connecting people with similar attributes and 2. helping them "break the ice".

#### How we built it
We built it using the following resources:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/api)
* [python-telegram-bot](python-telegram-bot.org)
* [libretranslate](libretranslate.com)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

#### Challenges we ran into
There were multiple challenges we have ran into during the process of completing this project:
1. Inline keyboard for telegram bot does not seem to work as we intended. Hence we decided to use a reply keyboard instead.
2. Some lack of technical knowledge. Some quick googling helped us greatly in this problem.

#### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to be able to accomplish the following features for our project:
1. A fully functional telegram bot
2. User data collection (for matching with others)
3. Auto translation capabilities
4. Database backend (using MongoDB)

#### What we learned
There were many learning points in this project:
1. Our technical knowledge in the areas of telegram bot building has improved
2. Process of engaging in a software project

#### What's next for IceBreakerBot
We hope to continue implementing the features that we wanted but was unable to due to lack of time, such as:
1. More/better content for ice breaking (currently this feature only sends out a randomised ice breaker question to get the conversation going).
2. Matching algorithm (currently we are unable to implement the matching algorithm properly to match users with others).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
<div id = "usage"></div>

## Usage

  DISCLAIMER: Using this telegram bot requires the collection of personal information. PLEASE MAKE SURE TO DRAFT A PRIVACY STATEMENT BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO EMULATE THIS PROJECT AND INFORM THE USER ABOUT THE COLLECTION OF ANY PERSONAL DATA.

  1. Type /find to answers some questions about yourself.

  2. Username of matched user will be sent to you by the bot.

  3. Proceed to create a telegram group chat with said matched user and this bot.

  4. In case matched user and yourself speak different languages, this bot will attempt to auto translate any non-command texts in the group chat (by default from "en" to "de", with "en", "de" and "es" currently available for selection).

  5. To set translation languages, type /setlang

  6. To toggle auto translation on/off, type /toggle_translation

  7. To BREAK SOME ICE, type /breakice
